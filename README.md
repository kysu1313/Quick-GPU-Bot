# 3080Plx
Definitely not my custom made web scraper bot for buying an RTX 3080. Nope definitely not that. 


If you want to use this bot and have it text you when it gets a hit. You will need to make a developer account on Twilio and add your private keys to the mssage.py class.
Like this:
CLIENT = Client("Account SID", "Auth Token")

You need to install GeckoDriver from here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases  and add it to your PATH environment variables.
Required Packages (PIP install): Twilio, Selenuim, Colorama, tqdm
